<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Over the years more than 7000 lectures of Srila Gurudeva were recorded.</p>

<p>Some disciples (diksa and siksa) of Srila Gurudeva have laboriously collected and diligently digitized thousands of lecture-cassettes recently. Since the recording, especially in the earlier years, was not undertaken systematically, multiple challenges
	remain to be tackled in the archives, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Undated lectures</li>
	<li>Fused lectures (Multiple lectures recorded on a single two-sided tape, now digitized into a single MP3 file)</li>
	<li>Lectures recorded simultaneously by different devotees giving rise to duplicates</li>
	<li>Impaired sound quality due to background noise, low volume, and so on</li>
	<li>Lectures interspersed with kirtanas, announcements, long pauses, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p><b>To systematically organize the archives (audio &amp; video) of Srila Gurudeva.</b></p>

<p>This archive will help in various ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To organize and title all lectures.</li>
	<li>To clean up the audio files (for sound quality and content) and the database of duplicates.</li>
	<li>For the Publication Team, this database will facilitate referencing for future publications/periodicals.</li>
	<li>To have a hard drive containing Srila Gurudeva’s hari-katha with the best quality, adequately titled and organized for easy navigation with minimum duplicates. This hard drive will be available to all devotees.</li>
</ul>

<p>This exercise will eventually translate into more hari-katha being released in the future in the form of quotes, articles, lecture transcriptions and books as well as organized, clearer audio files and easy access to all the recordings for devotees in
	general. These files will be uploaded on the internet to be viewed, listened and downloaded by interested devotees.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>All the lectures recorded on tapes have now been digitized and a master list has been created by assigning each lecture a unique serial number.</p>

<p>Now the exercise involves gradually titling and sorting the lectures by making a synopsis of their contents. It will work in either of the ways mentioned below.</p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>
<p><strong>If you have access to/ knowledge of the basics of Microsoft Excel (Or Numbers on Mac), this option is recommended.</strong></p>
<a href="#option-1" class="btn btn-primary">Go to guidelines for option 1</a>

<h3>Option 2</h3>
<p><strong>For those who don't have access to a computer and/ or Microsoft Excel, you can submit the details using an Online Submission Form. Please note: WhatsApp or Email is needed for coordination.</strong></p>
<a href="#option-2" class="btn btn-primary">Go to guidelines for option 2</a>

<h3>Option 3</h3>
<p>If you are unable to send us details using Excel as well as the Online Form, then you can write in clear handwriting on paper and send us photos of the same, so that other devotees can then enter it into Excel.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Note: If there is no response after the lectures are sent, the Audio Seva Team will send notifications requesting a status update. If, for some reason, there is still no response, after a period of 30 days (since the lectures were allocated), they will
	automatically be re-allotted to another devotee.</div>

<div id="option-1">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 class="guidelines-option">GUIDELINES FOR OPTION 1: Microsoft Excel (Or Numbers on Mac)</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The Audio Seva Team will first email you the <b>Audio Seva Guidelines </b>along with an <b>Excel template</b>, and a link for selecting audio files. The Excel template also has some sample rows filled out to illustrate how it needs to be done.</li>
	<li>As you hear the audio file, you would make a note of the points mentioned in the Excel sheet.</li>
	<li>Once the details are entered into Excel, they will be emailed back to us.</li>
	<li>At the outset, please send us the file after you have filled out details for 1-2 audio files, to ensure that we are on the same page. Then, after receiving feedback, you can continue to complete the assigned lectures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to fill out the Excel sheet</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The Excel sheet sent to you has several columns. Further in the guidelines, in the ‘<b>Columns’</b> section, you will find a brief description of how the columns are to be filled out. Please refer to the attached <a href="/audioseva/sites/default/files/guidelines/Pure%20Bhakti%20Audio%20Seva%20Template.xlsx">Excel template</a>.</li>
	<li>Please note that one audio file has to be filled out in <u><b>ONE&nbsp;ROW&nbsp;ONLY</b></u>. Please do not use multiple rows for one audio file (except for fused lectures). Please refer to the sample rows in the Excel template to see how it appears.
		Below, you will find how to input on different lines within the same cell.
		<ul>
			<li>Windows: Press Alt + Enter to go to the next line within the same cell.</li>
			<li>Mac: Press Control + Option + Command + Enter to go to the next line within the same cell.</li>
			<li>Wrap Text: If you are unable to see part of the text while typing, you might try the following: Select entire column by clicking on column name on top (gray strip with ‘A’, ‘B’, etc. written on it), right click (or press Ctrl 1), select ‘Format Cells’,
				select Alignment, check the box next to ‘Wrap text’ at the bottom of the window. There should be a ‘tick mark’ in this box. Then you will be able to see the entire text you are typing.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Please retain the first 2 rows of the template and delete the sample rows (Row # 3 onwards) before commencing the exercise of filling out the details.</li>
	<li>Do not use diacritics. For instance: Krsna will not be written as Kṛṣṇa in this sheet. This is for ease of searching the file later and for the benefit of devotees who are unaware about the usage of diacritics.</li>
	<li>If you are unsure about a particular detail, but feel it is important to mention, please put a question mark (?) at the end of the entry.</li>
	<li>If a specific detail is unavailable, please leave the cell blank. But remember, that any detail could help the overall effort!</li>
	<li>If the options provided for input in a particular column do not fit the detail you wish to input, please feel free to write your comments in any of the fields, as you deem fit. For instance, in the column “Category”, suppose the audio does not fit into
		the options provided (darsana/ walk/ lecture/ parikrama/ conference), please mention your inputs in detail in that cell.</li>
	<li>If the lecture is in a language you cannot understand or audio is inaudible, please make an entry for the file name with as much information as you can fill and write your comments in Column P.</li>
	<li>NOTE: If among a series of lectures allotted to you, you find that some are duplicates, with minor alterations, please mention your comments in the last column for each file with any relevant information about the file such as ‘Sound quality improved’,
		‘abrupt ending’, ‘casual talk deleted’, etc. If the other information is the same, you may simply leave those fields blank for that lecture. Please hear each file allotted to you from beginning to end and fill out the details. This will help us to identify
		the best quality audio, while sorting duplicates. Please refer Row #10.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Excel Columns</h3>

<h4>A. Tape Number</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Please write the original audio file name, as it is received from the Audio Seva Team.
		<ul>
			<li>The name consists of a series code, a serial number of the tape in that series and a side letter (A/B). Examples: SYA-125A, ML2-0567A, etc. Please maintain the format, as it gets easier to sort later.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>B. Fused Lectures</h4>

<ul>
	<li>While digitizing, multiple recordings on one side of the cassette merge together into one mp3. When you hear the audio, if you notice that there are various lectures with different themes/ dates/ locations etc. in the same audio file, then such an audio
		file is to be treated as a Fused lecture. If this is the case, write ‘Yes’ in this column. Otherwise please write ‘No’.</li>
	<li>Details for each segment of the Fused lecture&nbsp;—&nbsp;which means each of the individual recordings in the audio file&nbsp;—&nbsp;should be filled separately in a new row.</li>
	<li>For example, please refer Row #6, 7, 8 in the <a href="/audioseva/sites/default/files/guidelines/Pure%20Bhakti%20Audio%20Seva%20Template.xlsx">Excel template</a>. The same audio file&nbsp;—&nbsp;
		<nobr>DK-012A</nobr>&nbsp;—&nbsp;contains 3 lectures, hence for that one audio file (DK-012A), 3 different rows have been created to note the details of each individual lecture.</li>
</ul>

<h4>C. Timing (Only in the case of Fused Lectures)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Please write the timing when the new lecture begins and ends in min:sec or hr:min:sec format, as applicable.</li>
	<li>This will help the Audio Seva Team to separate the individual lectures and archive them with appropriate labeling.</li>
	<li>Please note that this column needs to be filled ONLY in the case of Fused lectures.</li>
</ul>

<h4>D. Date</h4>

<ul>
	<li>This is taken from the original file name OR from the lecture. Please maintain YYYY-MM-DD format.</li>
	<li>Please write the date of the recording if it can be obtained by hearing. For example, in the end of the lecture, some devotee might announce the date or the tithi (lunar day such as ekadasi, pratipata, etc. or special day such as Janmastami, Gaura Purnima,
		etc.)
	</li>
	<li>If you are unsure of the date, please put a ‘?’ after the suggestion.</li>
	<li>In the case that the date is missing, if any tithi is alluded to in the lecture, please mention it here, as it might help us to arrive at a date by backward calculation. For instance: Srila Gurudeva might say, “Tomorrow is Govardhan Annakuta. We will
		have a festival…” Then please mention ‘Tomorrow is Govardhan Annakuta’ here.</li>
	<li>This field is crucial for organizing the archive as well as identifying duplicates, so any information provided here may help.</li>
</ul>

<h4>E. Location</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Please specify any information that indicates a place of the recording.</li>
	<li>Write the name of the city here. If the city is not known, write the country name here.</li>
	<li>Also during a lecture you may ascertain whether it’s in a Matha, during parikrama, etc. Please mention this information here.</li>
</ul>

<h4>F. Category</h4>

<ul>
	<li>If you are able to determine whether it is a darsana, lecture, parikrama, walk or conference, please mention it here.
		<ul>
			<li><u>Darsana</u>: Comparatively casual talk, Q&amp;A, no prayers at the beginning and/ or end, guests visits, etc.</li>
			<li><u>Lecture</u>: Organised katha, with invocation offered at the beginning and/ or end, not much interaction, Srila Gurudeva speaking on a particular topic</li>
			<li><u>Parikrama</u>: Visiting specific parikrama spots (‘This is Nanda Baba’s palace, ‘Here Mahaprabhu took sannyasa’, etc.)</li>
			<li><u>Walk</u>: Q&amp;A with disciples, informal talk or discussion on specific topics, no invocation at beginning and/ or end, sounds of outdoors like chirping of birds, cars, etc.</li>
			<li><u>Conference</u>: A formal forum where various speakers have been invited to discuss about a particular topic. For instance: Rupa Gosvami Conference</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>G. Topics</h4>

<ul>
	<li>This column is helpful for titling and identifying duplicates.</li>
	<li>Please try to mention the important topics which Srila Gurudeva has touched upon in the lecture. If Srila Gurudeva is speaking from a particular scripture (e.g. Srimad Bhagavatam, Madhurya Kadambini, etc.), please mention the same here.</li>
	<li>Also mention topics spoken by devotees who Srila Gurudeva requested to speak, along with their names, if possible. (This is not applicable in the case of a conference, as per the category described for Column F above)</li>
	<li>Details are not to be mentioned. However, this should not be at the cost of missing out on some topic Srila Gurudeva is speaking about. Typically a 45 minute lecture would have 4-6 topics discussed, but if you are unsure whether to leave out a detail,
		rather mention it.</li>
	<li>Please write each topic on a separate line, but keep them within&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;row of the sheet.
		<ul>
			<li>Press Alt + Enter (Windows) or Control + Option + Command + Enter (Mac) to add a line break.</li>
			<li>Add a hyphen (-) at the beginning of each line for ease of reading.</li>
			<li>At the beginning of the cell, add an apostrophe ('), else Excel might read the contents beginning with a hyphen as a formula. This apostrophe won’t be visible once you exit the cell.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>H. Gurudeva Timings</h4>

<ul>
	<li>This column is to be filled only in the case of formal conferences, where many speakers are invited from outside.</li>
	<li>Note down only the minutes when Srila Gurudeva speaks in the recording.</li>

		instead of generalizing Manah Siksa 1</li>
	<li>It can also be a line he said in the kathas it is. E.g.: ‘Importance of guru-seva’, ‘No progress without seva’</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>N. Sound Issues</h4>

<ul>
	<li>This column is crucial for cleaning up the audio files for enhanced audibility.</li>
	<li>If the lecture has some sound issues like too much background noise, or long blank pauses, low sound or some part of the speech needs to be edited, please mention in this column with comments on what the issue is and minutes where the disturbance occurs</li>
