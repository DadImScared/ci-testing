    <ul>
    	<li>While digitizing, multiple recordings on one side of the cassette merge together into one mp3. When you hear the audio, if you notice that there are various lectures with different themes/ dates/ locations etc. in the same audio file, then such an audio
    		file is to be treated as a Fused lecture. If this is the case, choose ‘Yes’ in this field. Otherwise please choose ‘No’.</li>
    	<li>Details for each segment of the Fused lecture&nbsp;—&nbsp;which means each of the individual recordings in the audio file&nbsp;—&nbsp;should be filled separately in a new form.</li>
    	<li>For example, please refer Row #6, 7, 8 in the <a href="/audioseva/sites/default/files/guidelines/Pure%20Bhakti%20Audio%20Seva%20Template.xlsx">Excel template</a>. The same audio file&nbsp;—&nbsp;
    		<nobr>DK-012A</nobr>&nbsp;—&nbsp;contains 3 lectures, hence for that one audio file (DK-012A), 3 different rows have been created to note the details of each individual lecture.</li>
